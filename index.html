<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Born in California and raised US Air Force which means I bounced around every few years due to the military brat status. I mostly lived in the Pacific and West Coast area's growing up as my father tried to keep us confined to a region. I attended college in California and received a degree in digital media communications.</p>
<p>After college, I've largely worked in project management which started in the banking industry and ended up in the aviation industry which is where I am now. I, also, recently began a journey of learning beginning with coding and development.</p>
